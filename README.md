 VOCTOMIX CONFIG
===============================
Repo to store our voctomix config.

 Was ist voctomix?
----------------
> The C3VOC creates lecture recordings from German hacker/tech conferences. In the past we have used dvswitch very successfully but it has some serious limitations. Therefore we started looking for a replacement in 2014. We tested snowmix and gst-switch and while both did some things we wanted right, we realised that no existing tool would be able to fulfil all our wishes. Furthermore both are a nightmare to extend. So we decided to build our own implementation of a Live-Video-Mixer.
